title: Hello World!
---

In this general purpose blog, I'll try to expose myself and my experiences, both professional and personally.

I am Jorge Revuelta, an active iOS Developer for [Ebikemotion SL](https://www.ebikemotion.com/), and a PhD student at the [BISITE Research Group](https://bisite.usal.es/). In my routine, I try to combine my developer with my researcher career, which is hard many times. Both worlds have hard requirements and, in my case, is hard to share the knowledge between them. Each side have its pros and cons. The pros are always the capability of learn, such different and interesting things that Computer Science offers to the world. The cons are the effort needed to keep the tasks of everyday up-to-date.

In following posts I'll try to share my experiences and knowledge gathered over time.

See you soon :smiley:
